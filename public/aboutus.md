**About Us: Transforming Billboard Advertising with BillboardMarketplace**

Welcome to BillboardMarketplace, the online destination that's reshaping the landscape of outdoor advertising. Founded by the dynamic duo of David Rullo, a software engineering visionary, and Matt Crawford, a former out-of-home advertising executive, our platform was born from a shared vision to democratize billboard advertising. Our mission is to make prime billboard space accessible to all businesses, big or small, while eliminating the need for traditional billboard agencies and middlemen.

### Our Vision

At BillboardMarketplace, our vision is to empower businesses with the ability to harness the power of billboard advertising. We believe that every business should have the opportunity to shine on billboards, regardless of their size or advertising budget. By removing the complexities and intermediaries, we are making outdoor advertising more accessible, cost-effective, and efficient for all.

### The Origin Story

BillboardMarketplace was conceived by David Rullo, a brilliant software engineer, and Matt Crawford, a seasoned veteran in the out-of-home advertising industry. With diverse backgrounds and experiences, they came together to address the challenges faced by businesses when trying to secure billboard space.

The idea took root during one of their late-night brainstorming sessions, driven by their deep passion for advertising and a shared desire to disrupt the existing norms. They recognized the inefficiencies and high costs associated with the prevailing advertising model and were determined to bring about change.
